# Route-Optimization-System
- Developed a machine learning algorithm which finds the shortest path(s) out of total number of addresses the delivery van
has to travel.
- Implemented Machine learning algorithm such as K-Means Clustering to form clusters. Primâ€™s Algorithm to find the
minimum spanning tree and 2-Opt Algorithm to swap the coordinates and compare with previous route.
- Geopy Library is used to determine the coordinates of various cities. The System is developed by using Html, CSS
as front-end , Django (Python) as back-end and SQlite3 as a database.
